<section><h2 id="section1"><b>Data Science</b></h2>
<p>
Data science enables businesses to process huge amounts of structured and unstructured big data to detect patterns. This in turn allows companies to increase efficiencies, manage costs, identify new market opportunities, and boost their market advantage.

Asking a personal assistant like Alexa or Siri for a recommendation demands data science. So does operating a self-driving car, using a search engine that provides useful results, or talking to a chatbot for customer service. These are all real-life applications for data science.

  <section><h2 id="section2"><b>Definition of Data Science</b></h2>
<p>Data science is the practice of mining large data sets of raw data, both structured and unstructured, to identify patterns and extract actionable insight from them. This is an interdisciplinary field, and the foundations of data science include statistics, inference, computer science, predictive analytics, machine learning algorithm development, and new technologies to gain insights from big data.

To define data science and improve data science project management, start with its life cycle. The first stage in the data science pipeline workflow involves capture: acquiring data, sometimes extracting it, and entering it into the system. The next stage is maintenance, which includes data warehousing, data cleansing, data processing, data staging, and data architecture.

Data processing follows, and constitutes one of the data science fundamentals. It is during data exploration and processing that data scientists stand apart from data engineers. This stage involves data mining, data classification and clustering, data modeling, and summarizing insights gleaned from the data—the processes that create effective data.

Next comes data analysis, an equally critical stage. Here data scientists conduct exploratory and confirmatory work, regression, predictive analysis, qualitative analysis, and text mining. This stage is why there is no such thing as cookie cutter data science—when it’s done properly.

During the final stage, the data scientist communicates insights. This involves data visualization, data reporting, the use of various business intelligence tools, and assisting businesses, policymakers, and others in smarter decision making.
